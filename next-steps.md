# Next Steps:

##9/18
Need to get the classes sorted.
- What kind of symbology do we want?
- What do we want to do with the water class? (The one that is sea level 0 and lower?)

## 9/24
- the next step needs to be to try and figure out if the map is updatable. Is there a way to use leaflet to reset the flood coloring without having to reload the entire map?
