				<h2>Sea Level Rise</h2>
				<p>In the heart of present-day Osaka, Namba is stacked with clubs, restaurants, and eateries. Jumbo animatronic signs promise tourists a variety of fried and sauced culinary delights. Overflowing garbage cans spill onto the pavement and the heavily canalized river reflects the light of stories-tall neon signs, announcing their building&rsquo;s occupants. Grimey vendors abut the sterile whiteness of H&amp;M and the manicured lamplight of a multi-story starbucks. &ldquo;Namba&rdquo; itself is often written in hiragana, the Japanese syllabary, obscuring it&rsquo;s etymology. Visible on some subway signs and in the autocorrect trays of club-goers it&rsquo;s kanji mean &ldquo;difficult waves&rdquo;, a reference to Namba&rsquo;s past. </p>

				<p>[Possible map of Kawachi-ko, next to modern inundation map from Climate Central]</p>

				<p>Thousands of years ago large swaths of Osaka was under water. A massive lake, Kawachi-ko, stretched from the Seto Inland Sea deep into the modern city centre and extended north towards Kyoto. Namba was once a port on this now paved-and-built lake. Wedged between crowds of tourists, the gently-waving crab and illuminated fugu signs are the only reminders that Namba today is a mere seven kilometres from the sea. According to recent projections however, this may change.</p> 

				<p>The world is on track for a 3C increase in global temperature. According to some projections, this could raise median sea level by as much as 6.4 meters, and is far above the relative safety of the 2C threshold set out by the Paris Climate Agreement (Climate Central). In Osaka alone, over 5.2 million people would be affected. Both Namba and Umeda, Osaka&rsquo;s prime business district, would be irreversibly lost. </p>

				<p>Causes Imagine a block of ice weighing the same as Mt. Everest&ndash; 83 gigatons&ndash; melting into the sea every two years. Then imagine another, and another, each melting into the sea every two years over the course of a twenty year observation. According to a study published in 2014, this is the output of just one region of Antarctica, the Amundsen Sea Embayment. As the planet warms, water frozen in glaciers thaws and flows into the sea. Currently 90% of glaciers worldwide are shrinking. Greenland and Antarctica, both massive ice sheets, are the largest areas of glacial melting, and two of the main causes of sea level rise (Romm). The Greenland ice sheet is 3km thick in some places and were it to melt entirely, would raise sea level by more than 20 feet around the globe. The antarctic ice sheet meanwhile, is on average 2km thick and constitutes 90% of the world&rsquo;s ice. If it melted completely, sea levels would rise by 200 feet. Neither the Greenland nor the Antarctic ice sheet is likely to melt entirely. However, the speed at which they are melting is extremely disturbing.</p>

				<p>After the water melts it flows into the sea, where it continues warming. As water heats, it gets bigger. Globally oceans absorb about 90% of increased atmospheric heat. This means a lot of water expanding, and accounts for about half of the past century&rsquo;s sea level rise. As sea levels rise further, all of these processes speed up.</p>

				<p>The most obvious effect of sea level rise will be on beaches. Already increasing at a rate of about 5mm per year, Oceans gradually creep over the sands (WWF). The waves continually pounding the beaches advance, eroding coastlines. Homes and businesses, enviable for their view of the shore, will be undermined. Just a 0.3m rise would eliminate 50% of Japan&rsquo;s sandy beaches, while a 1m rise would overwhelm 90% (WWF). As humans will be forced to relocate, animals, fish, and plants will also see their habitats flooded.  

				<p>Meanwhile, and less visibly, seawater creeps into deltas and up rivers, decreasing their freshwater content and solidifying coastal soils. This sea water, denser than freshwater, travels through tiny pores into Japan&rsquo;s aquifers. Called saltwater intrusion, this process contaminates groundwater, making it saltier. Saltwater is no good to drink and no good for rice. According to one report, central and southern Japan could see a 40% decrease in rice yields due to climate change (WWF). While this decrease is not all the direct result of sea level rise, a 2015 study in Bangladesh found that as rivers and soil get saltier, as much as 15.6% of it&rsquo;s annual rice-yield could disappear. Climate change will also make once-extreme events worse. As the climate warms, more water vapour evaporates into the air. Downpours become stronger, and storms more powerful. Typhoons, fed by warmer waters, increase in strength. Moving toward land, typhoons push a swell of water in front of them. This swell&ndash; storm surge&ndash; is the most destructive part of the typhoon. When it combines with a natural high tide, it&rsquo;s height can reach over 20 feet. Waves rush inland, battering structures, flooding neighborhoods, and taking lives. Global warming will make these extreme events more likely, and once remarkable storm surges will become commonplace (Romm, WWF).  Urban Impacts Japanese cities have a lot to lose from 3C of sea level rise. 46% of Japan&rsquo;s population and 47% of Japan&rsquo;s industrial output are at risk from sea level rise and associated typhoons and storm surges. While all of Japan&rsquo;s largest cities are at risk from sea level rise, the effects will be felt unevenly. Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya will see the most people at risk from a 3C rise, have the most to gain from limiting climate change to 2C, and the most to lose should climate change progress to 4C.   </p>

				<p>People in affected areas will have to move, stressing non-affected areas, and local communities will be uprooted. The economic impacts of these changes will be immense. A report based on OECD data projected that in 2070 more than in Tokyo $1.2 trillion worth of infrastructure will be at risk of flooding. Osaka-Kobe will see $970 billion in at-risk assets, and Nagoya will see over $620 billion. Sea level rise will also cause huge disruption regionally. Eight of the world&rsquo;s ten largest cities are coastal, and over 275 million people internationally live in urban areas that will be flooded given 3C warming (Climate Central). While the chaos unleashed by climate change will be global, Asia will be disproportionately affected. 58.3% of affected cities in the Climate Central Data set are in Asia, and ten of those are Japanese. Globally, Shanghai will be the hardest-hit, however all of Japan&rsquo;s neighbors will have to contend with sea level rise. </p>

				<p>According to the IPCC, an intergovernmental report on climate change, &ldquo;Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence&rdquo; as well as increasing the severity of poverty and economic crises. (IPCC, Cited in Romm). Regionally, this will likely mean higher levels of migration, as well as increasing competition over natural resources (Climate and Security, Addressing Climate Change and Migration in Asia and the Pacific).  Asia is the most populous region globally, while also being the most affected by natural disasters. Climate change is likely to take the heaviest toll on the region (Addressing Climate Change and Migration in Asia and the Pacific). Despite it&rsquo;s currently restrictive immigration policy, Japan will not be immune from these effects. Between regional instability, changing levels of food security, and the direct displacement of its own citizens, 3C sea level rise will radically alter Japan. It&rsquo;s critical that planning for these scenarios begins now.  In Osaka, the municipal government&rsquo;s environmental bureau says that it expects that Osaka will be affected by climate-realted natural disasters and is discussing preventative measures, but has yet to investigate the full extent of the risk. The results of their planning will be pitted against whatever degree of climate change we choose as a society, either through concious choice or inaction.  </p>
