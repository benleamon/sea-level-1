## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Let's go
Load libraries: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

OK, I've got the data imported. Let's try and make a basic graph. 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = edited_table_A2_cities, 
            mapping = aes(x = pop_below_3_rise_level, 
                          y = reorder(Urban_agglomeration, pop_below_3_rise_level)))
p + geom_point(size = 0.3) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
Not bad, we need to group by regions though. 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = edited_table_A2_cities, 
            mapping = aes(x = pop_below_3_rise_level,
                          y = reorder(Urban_agglomeration, pop_below_3_rise_level),
                          color = Region))

p + geom_point(size = 0.3)
```

Not what we need. 
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = edited_table_A2_cities %>% arrange(Region, desc(pop_below_3_rise_level)) %>%
              mutate(city = factor(Urban_agglomeration, levels = Urban_agglomeration)),
            mapping = aes(x = city,
                          y = pop_below_3_rise_level,
                          fill = Region))

p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

OK! Thanks internet! (Answer found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43877663/order-multiple-variables-in-ggplot2)

Things that need to be updated: 
- Region grouping: Let's combine several of the regions. All of Europe can be together, as can all of Africa. Central America, South America, and the Carribean can also likely be grouped. 
- We should also label the most-affected city per group, and the Japanese cities.
- Let's reorer the groups. 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = edited_table_A2_cities %>% arrange(Region, desc(pop_below_3_rise_level)) %>%
              mutate(city = factor(Urban_agglomeration, levels = Urban_agglomeration)),
            mapping = aes(x = city,
                          y = pop_below_3_rise_level,
                          fill = Region))

p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_minimal()
```


Ok. Looks like there might be another way to do this with something called forcats in the tidyverse libarary. Let's give it a go. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(dplyr)

edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  mutate(ordering = -as.numeric(Region) + pop_below_3_rise_level, 
         city = fct_reorder(Urban_agglomeration, ordering, .desc = T)) %>% ggplot(aes(city, pop_below_3_rise_level, fill = Region)) + geom_col()


```

OK really not what I want. Copy and paste, subbign my data: 
```{r}
require(dplyr)
require(forcats)

edited_table_A2_cities %>% 
  mutate(ordering = -as.numeric(Region) + pop_below_3_rise_level,
         city = fct_reorder(Urban_agglomeration, ordering, .desc = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city, y = pop_below_3_rise_level, fill = Region)) + geom_col()
```
Not what we want. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
p <- ggplot(data = edited_table_A2_cities,
            mapping = aes(x = Urban_agglomeration,
                        y = pop_below_3_rise_level))
p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ Region, ncol = 18)
```
Also not what we want. 

Table summarizing the number of observations per region: 
```{r}
cities_by_region <- edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(N = n())

p <- ggplot(data = cities_by_region, 
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(Region, N),
                          y = N))
p + geom_bar(stat= "identity") + 
  coord_flip()+ 
  labs(title = "Number of Cities in Dataset per region")
```

Lets go back to the original plot: 
```{r}
# First we'll make a new table.
new_cities <- edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  # Sort by region, and then by descending population.  
  arrange(Region, desc(pop_below_3_rise_level)) %>%
  # Convert Urban_agglomeration to a factor, with the sorted ordering of the levels. 
  mutate(city = factor(Urban_agglomeration, levels = Urban_agglomeration))

p <- ggplot(data = new_cities,
            mapping = aes(x = city,
                          y = pop_below_3_rise_level))

p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ Region, scales="free_x",ncol = 18, strip.position = "bottom") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Regions",
       y = "Pop displaced(?) by 3ยบ Sea Level Rise") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
  
```
Examples relating to reordering (from https://trinkerrstuff.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/how-do-i-re-arrange-ordering-a-plot/)
```{r}
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(y=as.factor(carb), x=mpg, colour=hp)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r}
mtcars$carb2 <- factor(mtcars$carb, levels=rev(levels(factor(mtcars$carb))))
 
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(y=carb2, x=mpg, colour=hp)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(y=carb2, x=mpg, colour=hp)) +
    geom_point() + facet_grid(cyl~.)
```

```{r}
mtcars$cyl2 <- factor(mtcars$cyl, levels=c("6", "4", "8"))
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(y=carb2, x=mpg, colour=hp)) +
    geom_point() + facet_grid(cyl2~.)
```

Hook the charts together! Version 2 (or 3 or whatever)

# Data munging: Let's combine several of the region categories. 
 new_cities <- edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  mutate(big_region = recode(edited_table_A2_cities$Region, 
                             # Asia Group
                             "Eastern Asia" = "Asia", "South-Eastern Asia" = "Asia", "Southern Asia" = "Asia",

# First we'll make a new table.
#new_cities2 <- edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  # Sort by region, and then by descending population.  
  arrange(big_region, desc(pop_below_3_rise_level)) %>%
  # Convert Urban_agglomeration to a factor, with the sorted ordering of the levels.

# Let's make region in new_citeis a factor with levels. If you want to edit the order of the facets, you can edit the order of these factors. Detailed process instructions can be found here: https://trinkerrstuff.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/how-do-i-re-arrange-ordering-a-plot/ 
new_cities$big_region2 <- factor(new_cities$big_region, levels = c("Asia", "Africa", "Central and South America and the Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania"))

p <- ggplot(data = new_cities,
            mapping = aes(x = city,
                          y = pop_below_3_rise_level))

p + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ big_region2, labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = .5), scales="free_x",ncol = 18, strip.position = "bottom") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Regions",
       y = "Pop displaced(?) by 3ยบ Sea Level Rise") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

Ideally, I'd like to organize the order of the plots by the number of observations. Let's try and get that to work.

```{r}
cities_by_big_region <- new_cities %>%
  group_by(big_region) %>%
  summarize(N = n())

p <- ggplot(data = cities_by_big_region, 
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(big_region, N),
                          y = N))
p + geom_bar(stat= "identity") + 
  coord_flip()+ 
  labs(title = "Number of Cities in Dataset per region")
```

I don't think it's gonna be worth doing this programatically. Manual order ensues. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Data munging: Let's combine several of the region categories. 
 new_cities <- edited_table_A2_cities %>%
  mutate(big_region = recode(edited_table_A2_cities$Region, 
                             # Asia Group
                             "Eastern Asia" = "Asia", "South-Eastern Asia" = "Asia", "Southern Asia" = "Asia",
                             # Africa Group
                             "Western Africa" = "Africa", "South Africa" = "Africa", "Northern Africa"  = "Africa", "Middle Africa"  = "Africa", "Eastern Africa" = "Africa",
                             # Europe Group
                             "Northern Europe" = "Europe", "Western Europe" = "Europe", "Southern Europe" = "Europe", "Eastern Europe" = "Europe",
                             #South, Central America and Caribbean Group
                             "Central America" = "Central and South America and the Caribbean", "South America"= "Central and South America and the Caribbean", "Caribbean"= "Central and South America and the Caribbean",
                             # North America Group
                             "Northern America" = "North America",
                             # Middle East Group
